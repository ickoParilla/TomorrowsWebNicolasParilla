            My name is Nicolas Stanley Mancao Parilla, I was born in Manila Philippines on July 8 2003,
            I'm a middle child with one older sister, and one younger brother.

            My main hobbies are playing and interacting with my friends, sometimes both at the same time,
            I also enjoy coding but only do so when I need to.
            I also enjoy studying only when I find what I'm studying interesting, so I mostly like researching when it comes to games
            ,because what I care about the most is having fun and efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my life before Bath Spa, I studied Kindergarten in The Philippines, then I moved to Dubai to continue in
            TPS (The Philippines School) where I finished Primary Education, and Junior High school.
            Then, afterwards I moved to BSU to continue my education.
