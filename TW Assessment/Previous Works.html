        <h1>Games</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout my years in BSU, I've been tasked multiple times to make games, and Websites. These are some of the
            independent projects I did.

            <h2>First Game</h2>
            <p>
                My first game was made in Itch.io with Bitsy. The game is centered around the player who wakes up in a maze,
                and the goal is to get escape.

            <h2>Second Game</h2>
            <p>
                My second game was made with Twine/Twinery, an open-source tool for making interactive stories.
                The story of this game revolves aroung Little Red Riding Hood. But to make it my version, I made it so
                the player can play as both Little Red Riding Hood, and the Wolf.

            <h2>Third Game</h2>
            <p>
                My third and most recent game was made with Unity. The game doesn't really have a story, it's mostly just a 2D platformer
                game, where you play as a knight. Overall there are 5 levels, and by completing all of them you get the Ending.

        <h1>First independent HTML site</h1>
        <p>
            My first website might not be interesting to most people, but it's about my favorite game Genshin Impact.
            The website shows all the characters as of update 2.8, in the website the user can the the character's
            origin, birthday, rarity, type of weapon, and element.
